### Assumptions

- Each customer must have a unique customer_id.  
- A reservation must be linked to exactly one customer, but can involve multiple guests.  
- Tables are reused; one reservation = one table assignment, but tables can serve different reservations at different times.  
- Orders are always tied to an active reservation.  
- Bills are only generated once a reservation is completed.  
- Waiters may share service responsibilities across reservations.
